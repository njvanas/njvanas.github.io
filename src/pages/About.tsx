            My Journey in Cybersecurity
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-6 cyber-text-muted leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              My fascination with cybersecurity began at age 10 in the agricultural town of Grabouw, South Africa, 
              where I first encountered networking and computer hardware. This early exposure sparked a lifelong 
              passion for understanding how technology can both enable and protect human endeavors. Growing up 
              in an agricultural community taught me the importance of robust, reliable systems â€“ lessons that 
              directly translate to cybersecurity principles.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pivotal moment in my career came when I secured my first full-time position at the college 
              where I was studying, just six months into my course. This opportunity allowed me to apply 
              theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios immediately. I quickly progressed from basic IT 
              support to systems administration, taking on increasingly complex security challenges and 
              discovering my natural aptitude for identity and access management.
            </p>
            <p>
              My international move to the Netherlands marked a significant evolution in my career focus. 
              Restarting in a new country provided fresh perspectives on global cybersecurity challenges 
              and exposed me to advanced European compliance frameworks. This experience refined my approach 
              to security governance and deepened my expertise in Azure-based identity solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, I'm exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, investigating 
              how AI can enhance threat detection and automate security responses while maintaining the human 
              judgment essential for complex security decisions. My goal is to stay at the forefront of 
              cybersecurity innovation while never losing sight of the fundamental principle: technology 
              should serve and protect people, not complicate their lives.

              <p className="cyber-text-muted leading-relaxed">
                Every solution I design begins with security considerations. I believe that robust security 
                isn't an afterthought but the foundation upon which all reliable systems are built. This 
                approach has consistently resulted in implementations that exceed compliance requirements 
                while maintaining operational efficiency.

                The most secure system is worthless if users can't or won't use it properly. I prioritize 
                solutions that enhance security while improving user experience, understanding that adoption 
                and compliance are directly linked to usability and clear communication of security benefits.
